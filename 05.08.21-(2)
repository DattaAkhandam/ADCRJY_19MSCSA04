Algorithm:
Use three nested loops.
Outer loops will decide the starting point of a sub-array, call it as startPoint.
First inner loops will decide the group size (sub-array size). Group size starting from 1 and goes up array size. Letâ€™s call is as abc.
The most inner loop will actually print the sub-array by iterating the given array from startPoint and print the next abc elements.

Output:
1
1 2
1 2 3
2
2 3
3
